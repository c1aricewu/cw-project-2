			<td>Inspo = Inspiration. <br><br>
				This is my inspiration board or mood board that ended up looking a little bit like a mind map. This is how I began imagining this project but I started getting my ideas from Pinterest, making a project specific board that you can see below. <br><br> I find it important to have an abundance of inspiration and to draw upon successful designs when incorporating elements into your own project. When I had no ideas left, I went back to this annotation to merge things together into my current design. Of course, there was no way that I could use all the elements I found interesting- either because of difficulty in scope or it would be too convoluted. <br><br>I knew I wanted to have a minimal look to this website but I wanted to make sure it did not look like it was empty either. I realized that I could borrow the grid work from newspapers for bigger bodies of text and the regular left align for that jagged edge in less massive texts. <br><br> This was a really fun way to start <a href="../home.html">Project 2.</a></td></tr> </table>

			  <td><p>To plan and prototype the website, I started with a low fidelity sketch intending to create a layout using a few wireframes. You can select the sketches to open it in a new tab or zoom in to see the detail.<br><br>As you can see on the top left sketch, I began by drafting up a simple map for Information Architecture to plan out which pages would go where and with what links. The footer with an overview of the website is meant for clarity. I decided that it may not be the best to put all five pages as global navigation and as a such planned that out. <br><br> I borrowed a few things from the annotated inspiration pages that I found most interesting. There is a lot of inspiration from print publications like newspapers and magazines. Having worked with halftones before, I enjoyed using that to convey the print aesthetic where appropriate. See examples in my home page under <a href="../home.html">Project 2.</a><br><br> When putting together the website, I decided to add and ommit things from my initial sketches. </p></td>

		  <td><p>I used Adobe Dreamweaver to write HTML &amp; CSS code for this website. I also used Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to help me with some components. I also used YouTube to upload my videos and embedded Google Maps links. <br>
			  <br> My laptop is a MacBook Air 13.3-inch M1 2020 and I used Google Chrome, with the Toolbar and Bookmarks Bar open on full screen at 100% zoom, to preview this website. I believe this is where it would work best.</p></td>
		  <td><p>This has been a long learning experience during the contract in-class practical hours as well as in my independent study. I understand how the Adobe Suite can work in conjunction with each other as well as how to best organize the workflow of coding.<br><br> When concluding the project, I realized that I should have learned how to organize my code better, what the syntax structure should look like to keep it tidy. Though my code is quite messy objectively, subjectively it works for me and I can still find everything.</p></td>
		  <td><p>Because there are lines upon lines upon pages and pages of code, I definitely found it difficult to keep up with everything. It was very helpful that I planned in advance and took things chunks at a time to accomplish what I wanted in the end. <br><br>There probably are still some difficulties and few minor inconsistencies within the website but nothing that disrupts the overall function. One thing to note is that at times the code works but when reopening it, the function inexplicably differs.</p></td>

	 <h3>Accessibility.</h3>
		  <table>
		  <tr>
		  <td>
		When considering making a website that is accessible, we may think of those with certain accessiblility needs and catering to those. However, I have come to understand that it can also take into account access as a whole. How can people access the information they are looking for on your website? Clearly, it is still very important to consider accessibility needs and standards which is why this website has adhered to WCAG 2.0 standards (W3C, n.d.). <br><br> I have taken into account color contrast by testing out different colors I was initially interested in through the WebAIM site (n.d.) to figure out which combination would be best. I ended up with #F9EFE4 in the background and #631A1B in the foreground which passes the contrast tests. A high contrast can in colors can also cause strain with longterm use so I believe that I chose good colors at a reasonable ratio. <br><br> As well, though the recommendation minimum recommendation (W3C, n.d.) is 12px (9pt), I wanted to ensure it would be legible and made it minimum 14px but most text is 16px. I wanted to the print look so I decided to use a serif font. However, serif fonts can often be thin and as such I found a font, for the body of the website, that was not too drastic in thickness change. I also tried sans-serif fonts, but decided against it.</td>

		  <p><center>I have left the global navigation at the top with a large title concluded with a border to mimic a newspaper headline. Similarly, the footer is for additional navigational aid using the  principles of Disclosure and Front Doors (Brown, 2010), but also to end the page the same way it began. You can notice that the dotted underline is limited to the header global navigation and the footer to convey this. Additionally, both sections use the same font to tie it further. To show an alignment between the body, which has a different font, and the aforementioned sections, I mimic the separation thin double line with the singular thin line that you can see when hovering over a link or when it is active. Additionally, the dotted lines in the header and footer is losely reflected by the halftone photos where appropriate.</center></p>
